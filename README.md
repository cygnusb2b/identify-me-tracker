# Identify Me! Tracker
JavaScript user tracking library.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies. Requires the use of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), which can be installed using Homebrew on MacOS.
```
yarn install
```

## Development
Once the dependencies are installed, you can build the library (with live-reload and HMR) by executing:
```
npm run start:dev
```
This will build the code (using Webpack) into the `/dist` folder. You can now access the tracker test page at `http://localhost:3080`.
